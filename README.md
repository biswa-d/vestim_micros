# VEstim - ML Model Training Tool

VEstim is a machine learning model training tool designed specifically for battery and supercapacitor voltage estimation. It provides a complete workflow from data import to model training and evaluation, with a user-friendly interface.

## New Client-Server Architecture

VEstim now uses a client-server architecture that provides several benefits:

1. **Resilience**: Training continues even if the GUI crashes
2. **Persistence**: Jobs and tasks are tracked properly
3. **Monitoring**: Multiple jobs can be tracked through the dashboard
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend and backend are properly decoupled

See [CLIENT_SERVER_GUIDE.md](CLIENT_SERVER_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on using the new architecture.

## Features

- **Data Import**: Import and preprocess data from various sources (Arbin, STLA, Digatron, etc.)
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhance your dataset with resampling and feature engineering
- **Hyperparameter Selection**: Tune model hyperparameters for optimal performance
- **Model Training**: Train LSTM models with automatic parameter tuning
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance with comprehensive metrics
- **Job Dashboard**: Monitor and manage multiple training jobs

## Installation

### Quick Installation

Using the provided setup script:

#### Windows
```cmd
vestim_setup.cmd install
```

#### Linux/Mac
```bash
chmod +x vestim_setup.sh
./vestim_setup.sh install
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Starting VEstim

Start the server and GUI:

```bash
vestim all
```

Or start components separately:

```bash
# Start the server
vestim server

# Start the GUI
vestim gui
```

### Workflow

1. **Data Import**: Select your data files and preprocess them
2. **Data Augmentation**: Enhance your dataset as needed
3. **Hyperparameter Selection**: Configure your model parameters
4. **Training**: Train your model with the selected parameters
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance on test data
