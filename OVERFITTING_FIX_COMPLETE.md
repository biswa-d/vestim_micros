# OVERFITTING/DATA LEAKAGE FIX - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Summary of Changes Made

### Problem Addressed
- **Root Cause**: Random splitting of overlapping LSTM sequences led to heavy overlap between train and validation data, causing artificially low validation loss and overfitting.
- **Solution**: Implemented a three-folder structure (train, validation, test) with separate, non-overlapping data to eliminate data leakage.

### Files Modified

#### 1. Data Import GUI (`vestim/gui/src/data_import_gui_qt.py`)
- ✅ Added validation folder selection UI
- ✅ Updated folder selection logic to require all three folders
- ✅ Updated FileOrganizer to handle train, val, test files separately
- ✅ Updated FileOrganizer.run() to call new three-parameter backend methods

#### 2. Data Processors
- ✅ **Arbin Processor** (`vestim/services/data_processor/src/data_processor_qt_arbin.py`)
  - Updated `organize_and_convert_files()` to accept train_files, val_files, test_files
  - Creates separate val_data/raw_data and val_data/processed_data folders
  - Processes validation files alongside train and test files

- ✅ **STLA Processor** (`vestim/services/data_processor/src/data_processor_qt_stla.py`)
  - Updated `organize_and_convert_files()` to accept train_files, val_files, test_files
  - Creates separate validation folder structure
  - Processes validation files with same conversion logic

- ✅ **Digatron Processor** (`vestim/services/data_processor/src/data_processor_qt_digatron.py`)
  - Updated `organize_and_convert_files()` to accept train_files, val_files, test_files
  - Creates separate validation folder structure
  - Processes validation CSV files
  - Fixed numpy import issue

#### 3. Data Loader Service (`vestim/services/model_training/src/data_loader_service.py`)
- ✅ Added new method `create_data_loaders_from_separate_folders()`
- ✅ Supports both LSTM/GRU and FNN models with three-folder structure
- ✅ Returns train_loader, val_loader, test_loader (backward compatible)
- ✅ Eliminates need for train_split parameter

#### 4. Training Task Manager (`vestim/gateway/src/training_task_manager_qt.py`)
- ✅ Updated `create_data_loaders()` to use new three-folder method
- ✅ Uses job_folder path instead of just train folder
- ✅ Removed train_val_split parameter usage

#### 5. Hyperparameter Management
- ✅ **Hyperparameter GUI** (`vestim/gui/src/hyper_param_gui_qt.py`)
  - Removed train-validation split UI elements
  - Removed TRAIN_VAL_SPLIT from parameter collection

- ✅ **Training Setup Manager** (`vestim/gateway/src/training_setup_manager_qt.py`)
  - Removed train_val_split from hyperparameter parsing
  - Removed train_val_split loop from task generation
  - Removed TRAIN_VAL_SPLIT from task info creation

- ✅ **Hyperparameter Manager** (`vestim/gateway/src/hyper_param_manager_qt.py`)
  - Removed TRAIN_VAL_SPLIT from float validation list

- ✅ **Test Files** (`vestim/services/model_training/src/hyper_param_manager_qt_test.py`)
  - Removed TRAIN_VAL_SPLIT from test parameters

#### 6. Gateway Components
- ✅ **Gateway Hyperparameter GUI** (`vestim/gateway/src/hyper_param_gui_qt.py`)
  - Removed TRAIN_VAL_SPLIT from parameter collection

### Folder Structure Now Created
```
job_folder/
├── train_data/
│   ├── raw_data/        # Original training files
│   └── processed_data/  # Converted training files
├── val_data/
│   ├── raw_data/        # Original validation files  
│   └── processed_data/  # Converted validation files
└── test_data/
    ├── raw_data/        # Original test files
    └── processed_data/  # Converted test files
```

### Key Benefits
1. **Eliminates Data Leakage**: No overlap between train, validation, and test data
2. **Better Generalization**: True validation performance assessment
3. **Cleaner Architecture**: Removes complex train_split logic
4. **User Control**: Users can organize their data appropriately before import
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing training workflow still works

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test the new data import workflow with all three data sources (Arbin, STLA, Digatron)
2. Verify that job folders are created with correct three-folder structure
3. Confirm that training proceeds without train_val_split parameter
4. Validate that models train and validate on separate data
5. Check that validation loss is now more realistic (likely higher than before)

### Documentation Updates Needed
- Update user guide to explain new three-folder requirement
- Add instructions for organizing data into train/val/test folders
- Update troubleshooting guide for overfitting issues

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
All major components have been updated to support the new three-folder workflow and eliminate the train:val split parameter. The system now prevents data leakage by design.
