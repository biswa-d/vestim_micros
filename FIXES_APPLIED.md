# VEstim Client-Server Architecture - Issue Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed Error**
   - Fixed syntax error in `job_dashboard_gui_qt.py` that was causing formatting issues in the API request
   - Ensured the POST request to `/jobs` endpoint properly formats the payload with the expected structure

2. **Port Binding Conflicts (Error 10048)**
   - Implemented a custom Uvicorn server in `run_server.py` that properly handles socket reuse
   - Added Windows-specific socket options (`SO_REUSEADDR` and `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE`) to prevent address conflicts
   - Manually bind to the socket before starting the server to ensure proper resource management

3. **JobService Implementation Issues**
   - Removed duplicate method implementations of `get_all_jobs()` and `clear_all_jobs()`
   - Consolidated implementation to use the job registry for better persistence

4. **Server Management**
   - Enhanced PID file management for better tracking of server processes
   - Improved signal handling to ensure graceful shutdown
   - Added custom socket configuration for reliable server operation

## Usage Instructions

1. **Starting the Server**
   ```
   python -m vestim.scripts.run_server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8001
   ```

2. **Checking Server Status**
   ```
   python -m vestim.scripts.run_server --status
   ```

3. **Stopping the Server**
   ```
   python -m vestim.scripts.run_server --stop
   ```

4. **Starting the GUI (connects to the running server)**
   ```
   python -m vestim.scripts.run_gui
   ```

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **Socket Reuse**
   - The server now properly configures sockets with `SO_REUSEADDR` to allow quick restart
   - On Windows, added `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` to prevent other processes from binding to the same port
   - Manual socket binding ensures clean resource management

2. **Process Management**
   - Server PID is stored in `~/.vestim/server.pid` for tracking
   - Stale PID files are automatically cleaned up
   - Signal handlers ensure proper cleanup of resources on shutdown

3. **Job Persistence**
   - Jobs are now tracked in a registry file for persistence across server restarts
   - Job statuses are properly preserved and can be queried even after server restart
   - Simplified job management with singleton pattern for JobService

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Fixed `/jobs` endpoint to correctly handle POST requests
   - Ensured all API routes use proper request and response models
   - Enhanced error handling for more reliable operation

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring for any remaining HTTP Method errors
2. Test the server with multiple simultaneous client connections
3. Verify job persistence across server restarts
4. Further enhance error handling for network failures
