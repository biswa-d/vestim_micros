**Evaluation Metrics**:
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error): Average prediction error
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error): Penalizes large errors more
- **R²** (R-squared): How well model explains variance (closer to 1 = better)

**💡 Tip**: Good models typically achieve R² > 0.95 for battery voltage estimation.

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Using Your Own Data

1. **Data Format Requirements**:
   - CSV files with headers
   - Required columns: timestamp, voltage, current, temperature, SOC
   - Time-series data (sequential measurements)

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Ensure consistent sampling rates
   - Remove large gaps in data
   - Check for reasonable value ranges

3. **File Organization**:
   - Place training files in `data/train_data/`
   - Place validation files in `data/val_data/`
   - Place test files in `data/test_data/`

### Model Optimization

1. **If Model Performance is Poor**:
   - Increase hidden units (10 → 50 → 100)
   - Add more layers (1 → 2 → 3)
   - Increase training epochs (5 → 20 → 50)
   - Check data quality and preprocessing

2. **If Training is Too Slow**:
   - Reduce batch size (200 → 100 → 50)
   - Reduce lookback window (400 → 200 → 100)
   - Use fewer hidden units
   - Enable GPU if available

3. **If Model Overfits** (great training, poor testing):
   - Reduce model complexity (fewer units/layers)
   - Increase validation patience
   - Add more training data

### Hyperparameter Tuning Tips

- **Hidden Units**: Start with 10, increase if underfitting
- **Layers**: Usually 1-2 layers sufficient for battery data
- **Lookback**: 400 works well for battery data (adjust based on sampling rate)
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0001 is conservative and stable
- **Batch Size**: Larger = more stable, smaller = faster updates

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "No data files found"
- **Solution**: Ensure CSV files are in the correct folders
- Check file format and headers match expected columns

#### "Training fails immediately"
- **Solution**: Check data for NaN values or infinite numbers
- Verify all selected feature columns exist in your data
- Try reducing batch size or model complexity

#### "Poor model performance"
- **Solution**: 
  - Ensure data normalization is enabled
  - Check that voltage values are reasonable
  - Verify train/validation/test splits represent similar conditions
  - Try increasing model complexity gradually

#### "Out of memory errors"
- **Solution**:
  - Reduce batch size (200 → 100 → 50)
  - Reduce lookback window (400 → 200)
  - Use smaller model (fewer hidden units)
  - Close other applications

#### "Training takes too long"
- **Solution**:
  - Reduce max epochs for initial testing
  - Use smaller datasets for experimentation
  - Enable early stopping (patience setting)

## 📚 Understanding Machine Learning Concepts

### Time Series Prediction
VEstim predicts future voltage values based on historical patterns in:
- State of Charge (SOC)
- Current draw
- Temperature
- Previous voltage values

### Model Types Explained

**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:
- Best for capturing long-term dependencies
- Handles sequential data very well
- Recommended for battery voltage prediction
- More complex but typically more accurate

**GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**:
- Simpler than LSTM, faster training
- Good balance of performance and efficiency
- Alternative when LSTM is too slow

**FNN (Feed-Forward Neural Network)**:
- Simplest model type
- Treats each data point independently
- Fast training and prediction
- Good for non-sequential patterns

### Training Process
1. **Forward Pass**: Model makes predictions
2. **Loss Calculation**: Compare predictions to actual values
3. **Backward Pass**: Adjust model weights to reduce error
4. **Repeat**: Continue until model converges or max epochs reached

### Validation
- Uses separate data to check if model generalizes well
- Prevents overfitting (memorizing training data)
- Automatic early stopping when validation stops improving
